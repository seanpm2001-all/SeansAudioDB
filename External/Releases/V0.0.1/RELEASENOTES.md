# Sean's Audio Database

Conversion update 1
-----------

As part of my new plan to fully convert projects to GitHub for better management, I have began to add more repositories to GitHub manually.

For this project, I was able to import 54 versions of the database script today. I added over half of the total database scripts.

This program is far from complete, and is intended for personal use.

**Pre-release**
