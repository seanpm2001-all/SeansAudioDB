## V0.0.11

### About

This is the first update I am making to the audio collection today on GitHub. It is the first update in nearly a whole month, and the first update to be made on Linux.

This update changes some things, including:

> * Adds in directories that start with the letter `k` for the music folder, the projectless music folder, and the sound effects folder

> * Deleted many of `IGNORE.md` files

> * Added the first version of the bardcore directory

> * Added 100 new playlists

> * Adds more notes

This project is not intended for public use.
