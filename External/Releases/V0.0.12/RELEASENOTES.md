# Version 0.0.12 - August 6th 2020

## V0.0.12

### About

This is the first update I am making to the audio collection today on GitHub. It is the first update in nearly a whole month, and the second update to be made on Linux.

This update changes some things, including:

> * Adds in directories that start with the letter `l` for the music folder, the projectless music folder (0) and the sound effects folder

> * Deleted many of `IGNORE.md` files

> * Added 100 new playlists

> * Added the .txt file extension to the license, so that it bears an extension

> * Added more notes

This project is not intended for public use. I intend to try and update this project more frequently until I finish catching up. I will need to get through 14 more letters first, so 14 more versions.
