# Version 0.0.13 - August 7th 2020

## V0.0.13

### About

This is the first update I am making to the audio collection today on GitHub. It is the third update to be made on Linux. I began to utilize the GitHub folder upload feature in this release, as I just learned it on August 7th 2020. I also began to use new custom labels in the issues tab, my first usage of this on GitHub.

This update changes some things, including:

> * Adds in directories that start with the letter `m` for the music folder, the projectless music folder, and the sound effects folder

> * Deleted many of `IGNORE.md` files

This project is not intended for public use. I intend to try and update this project more frequently until I finish catching up. I will need to get through 13 more letters first, so 13 more versions.
