## V0.0.14

### About

This is the first update I am making to the audio collection today on GitHub. It is the fourth update to be made on Linux. I didn't utilize the GitHub folder upload feature as much as I should have. There was a 7 day period between this update and the previous, I have been having some productivity issues lately. I worked really hard today to get over them.

This update changes some things, including:

> * Adds in directories that start with the letter `N` for the music folder, the projectless music folder, and the sound effects folder, along with the missing M section folder in the SFX directory.

> * Deleted many of the `IGNORE.md` files

> * Added some new notes

> * Added the latest 100 VLC playlists

> * No other changes in this release

This project is not intended for public use. I intend to try and update this project more frequently until I finish catching up. I will need to get through 12 more letters first, so 12 more versions.
