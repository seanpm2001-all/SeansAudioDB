## V0.0.15

### About

This is the first update I am making to the audio collection today on GitHub. It is the fifth update to be made on Linux. I again realized that I didn't utilize the GitHub folder upload feature as much as I should have. 

This update changes some things, including:

> * Adds in directories that start with the letter `O` for the music folder, and the projectless music folder (the sound effect folder had no new directories starting with the letter `o`)

> * Deleted many of the `IGNORE.md` files

> * No other changes in this release

This project is not intended for public use. I intend to try and update this project more frequently until I finish catching up. I will need to get through 12 more letters first, so 12 more versions.
