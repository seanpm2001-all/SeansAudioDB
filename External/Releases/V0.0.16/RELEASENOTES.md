## V0.0.16

### About

This is the first update I am making to the audio collection today on GitHub. It is the sixth update to be made on Linux. I again realized that I didn't utilize the GitHub folder upload feature as much as I should have. I keep forgetting.

This update changes some things, including:

> * Adds in directories that start with the letter `P` for the music folder, and the projectless music folder and the sound effect folder.

> * Deleted many of the `IGNORE.md` files

> * Added some new directories (created within the past week) covering A-P sections

> * Added a new note file

> * No other changes in this release

This project is not intended for public use. I intend to try and update this project more frequently until I finish catching up. I will need to get through 12 more letters first, so 12 more versions.
