# Version 0.0.17 - August 16th 2020

## V0.0.17

### About

This is the second update I am making to the audio collection today on GitHub. It is the seventh update to be made on Linux. I again realized that I didn't utilize the GitHub folder upload feature as much as I should have. I keep forgetting.

This update changes some things, including:

> * Adds in directories that start with the letter `Q` for the music folder (the projectless music directory and sound effect directory had no entries starting with the letter `Q`)

> * Deleted many of the `IGNORE.md` files

> * No other changes in this release

This project is not intended for public use. I intend to try and update this project more frequently until I finish catching up. I will need to get through 9 more letters first, so 9 more versions.
