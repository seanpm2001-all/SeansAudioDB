# Version 0.0.18 - August 17th 2020

## V0.0.18

### About

This is the first update I am making to the audio collection today on GitHub. It is the eighth update to be made on Linux. I again realized that I didn't utilize the GitHub folder upload feature as much as I should have. I keep forgetting.

This update changes some things, including:

> * Adds in directories that start with the letter `R` for the music folder, projectless music folder, and sound effect folder

> * Deleted many of the `IGNORE.md` files

> * Added some new notes

> * No other changes in this release

This project is not intended for public use. I intend to try and update this project more frequently until I finish catching up. I will need to get through 8 more letters first, so 8 more versions.
