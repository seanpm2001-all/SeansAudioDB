# Version 0.0.19 - August 18th 2020

## V0.0.19

### About

This is the first update I am making to the audio collection today on GitHub. It is the ninth update to be made on Linux.

This update changes some things, including:

> * Adds in directories that start with the letter `S` for the music folder, projectless music folder, and sound effect folder

> * Deleted many of the `IGNORE.md` files

> * No other changes in this release

This project is not intended for public use. I intend to try and update this project more frequently until I finish catching up. I will need to get through 7 more letters first, so 7 more versions.

GitHub version: `19 (Version 0.0.19 - August 18th 2020) - at 10:43 am (S update)`
