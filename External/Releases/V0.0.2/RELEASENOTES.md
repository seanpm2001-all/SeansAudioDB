# Conversion update 2

This update marks the full conversion of the main database files and their notes. I have censored certain information from the files (only my phone number) and I have made them ready for GitHub.

This update adds several dozen new files to the project, and now I can start casually working on it.

This project is intended for my personal use. You are free to use it, but it isn't designed for other purposes. I plan on making a separate version that is designed for public use, I have been planning it all of May 2020, and now with GitHub, I feel like I have the resources to actually do it.

** **Pre-release** **

V0.0.2 - Conversion update 2
