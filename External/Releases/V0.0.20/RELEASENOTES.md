# Version 0.0.20 - August 18th 2020

## V0.0.20

### About

This is the second update I am making to the audio collection today on GitHub. It is also the tenth update to be made on Linux.

This update changes some things, including:

> * Adds in directories that start with the letter `T` for the music folder, projectless music folder, and sound effect folder

> * Deleted many of the `IGNORE.md` files

> * No other changes in this release

This project is not intended for public use. I intend to try and update this project more frequently until I finish catching up. I will need to get through 6 more letters first, so 6 more versions. The S and T updates were the biggest updates. I feel like I should be able to finish this project within a few days now. I really utilized the folder upload functionality with this release to save significant amounts of time, and reduce the amount of commits required to finalize this release.

Commits in this release: `3,631`

Commits in last release: `3,307`

Commit change: `324`

GitHub version: `20 (Version 0.0.20 - August 18th 2020) - at 6:48 pm (T update)`
