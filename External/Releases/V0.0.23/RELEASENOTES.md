# Version 0.0.23 - August 20th 2020

## V0.0.23

### About

This is the first update I am making to the audio collection today on GitHub. It is also the thirteenth update to be made on Linux.

This update changes some things, including:

> * Adds in directories that start with the letter `W` for the music folder, projectless music folder, and sound effect folder 

> * Deleted many of the `IGNORE.md` files

> * No other changes in this release

This project is not intended for public use. I intend to try and update this project more frequently until I finish catching up. I will need to get through 3 more letters first, so 3 more versions. The S and T updates were the biggest updates. I feel like I should be able to finish this project within a few days now. I really utilized the folder upload functionality with this release to save significant amounts of time, and reduce the amount of commits required to finalize this release.

Commits in this release: `3,957`

Commits in last release: `3,817`

GitHub version: `23 (Version 0.0.23 - August 20th 2020) - at 11:35 am (W update)`
