# Version 0.0.25 - August 20th 2020

## V0.0.25

### About

This is the third update I am making to the audio collection today on GitHub. It is also the fifteenth update to be made on Linux.

This update changes some things, including:

> * Adds in directories that start with the letter `Y` for the music folder, the projectless music folder, and the sound effect folder

> * Deleted many of the `IGNORE.md` files

> * No other changes in this release

This project is not intended for public use. I intend to try and update this project more frequently until I finish catching up. I will need to get through 1 more letter first, so 1 more version. The S and T updates were the biggest updates. I feel like I should be able to finish this project within a few days now. I really utilized the folder upload functionality with this release to save significant amounts of time, and reduce the amount of commits required to finalize this release.

Commits in this release: `4,097`

Commits in last release: `4,028`

GitHub version: `25 (Version 0.0.25 - August 20th 2020) - at 1:43 pm (Y update)`
