Conversion update 3 - June 8th 2020

# Conversion update 3 - June 8th 2020

A nightly conversion update, where I continue to add directories and their files. Starting tomorrow, I will try to add in 1 section a day (Section C in 1 day, Section D in 2 days, etc)

This update includes:

> * Playlists up to 200
> * Blank music folders for sections A and B in the main music folder
> * Blank music folders for sections ! and partially A in the main sound effects folder

I also plan on uploading some music to the repository, but I am going to keep it small, and only upload music that is in the public domain.
