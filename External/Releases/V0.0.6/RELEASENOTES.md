# `Conversion update 6 - June 11th 2020`

## Version 0.0.6

### About

I spent the majority of my time (over 4 hours) on GitHub today working on the audio collection project. I have started making some changes to ensure finalization of the structure, and also added tons of new playlists. I found out on my own today that this file structure is actually useful, as it serves as a backup of the file system for the audio collection structure, as it is always changing.

Today, I did a number of things, including:

> * Removing `IGNORE.md` files for directories from yesterday and the days before, as they are no longer needed in directories that already have files. Directories that don't have any files other than the `IGNORE.md` file were ignored

> * Added in playlists for the `F` section in the `1 Music/` directory

> * Added in important folders, and series folders up to `F` for the `1 Music/` directory

> * Added in some subfolders for the `!!Other` directory inside the `1 Music/` directory

> * Added in playlists for the `F` section in the `2 Music (Projectless)/` directory

> * Added in playlists for the `F` section in the `3 Sound effects/` directory

I spent several hours and made hundreds of commits for this update today.
