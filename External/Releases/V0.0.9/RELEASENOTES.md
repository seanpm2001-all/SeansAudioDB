# Version 0.0.9 (Fathers day update 3) - June 21st 2020

## V0.0.9

### About

This is the 3rd update I am making to my personal audio collection today. I originally intended to stop at 2 fathers day updates, but I felt like continuing, as I am making a lot of progress today, and I want to work on this whenever I really feel like it.

This update changes some things, including:

> * Adds in directories that start with the letter `i` for the music folder, the sound effect folders, but not the projctless music folder, as it doesn't have any directories in its root that start with the letter `i`
> * Deleted a massive amount of `README.md` files
> * Updated the CastleVania NES OST folder
> * Updated the main music series folders, so that they contain all the directory data

This project is not intended for public use.
