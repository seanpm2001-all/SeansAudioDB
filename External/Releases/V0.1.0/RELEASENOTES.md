# Version 0.1.0 - August 20th 2020

## V0.1.0

### About

This is the fourth update I am making to the audio collection today on GitHub. It is also the sixteenth update to be made on Linux.

This update changes some things, including:

> * Adds in directories that start with the letter `Z` for the music folder, and the sound effect folder (the projectless music folder was already completed in the last update, there are no folders starting with the letter Z in the projectless music directory)

> * Added 6 missing directories to the Music folder, finalizing it

> * Added 6 missing directories to the SFX folder, and deleting 3 duplicate directories, finalizing it

> * Added some new notes

> * Added some of the other original files to the root of the music directory

> * Deleted many of the `IGNORE.md` files

> * No other changes in this release

I have now finalized the upload of this project. New releases will offer support for the newer changes made to the project.
