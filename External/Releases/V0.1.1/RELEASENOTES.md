## V0.1.1

### About

This is the first update I am making to the audio collection today on GitHub. It is also the seventeenth update to be made on Linux. Since I am all caught up, new changes will only be made after a days worth of playlist creation.

This update changes some things, including:

> * Deleted many of the `IGNORE.md` files

> * Added some new playlists

> * Added some new notes

> * Added a release history section

> * Added some new playlist directories

> * No other changes in this release

This is the first update after the full catchup process.
