# Version 0.1.2 - September 5th 2020 update

## V0.1.2

### About

This is the first update I am making to the audio collection today on GitHub. It is also the eighteenth update to be made on Linux. Since I am all caught up, new changes will only be made after a days worth of playlist creation. This is the 2nd release following this pattern

I haven't been creating new releases with every day of change, I am going to try and fix that, starting with this release.

This update changes some things, including:

> * Deleted many of the `IGNORE.md` files

> * Added some new playlists

> * Added some new notes

> * Added a release history section

> * Added some new playlist directories

> * No other changes in this release

This is the second update after the full catchup process.
