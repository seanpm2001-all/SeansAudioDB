# About the ! 0 overview system

This is an info center that is outdated. It hosts a word document from October 7th 2018. It explains the music collection a bit, but was kept for historical purposes.

The file was optimized for Microsoft Word 2013, and does not work well in other office suites, such as LibreOffice.
