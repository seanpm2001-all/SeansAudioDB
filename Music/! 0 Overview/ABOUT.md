# About the ! 0 overview system

This is an info center that is outdated. It hosts a word document from October 7th 2018. It explains the music collection a bit, but was kept for historical purposes.

The file was optimized for Microsoft Word 2013, and does not work well in other office suites, such as LibreOffice.

File version: 2 (May 29th 2020 at 4:00 pm) - repurposed from an ignore file to a info file.
