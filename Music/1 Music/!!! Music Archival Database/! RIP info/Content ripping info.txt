How I got this audio

Some of this audio was just downloaded, but most of it was ripped.

Google says that ripping their videos is "wrong" and "against their terms of service" but since they have an option on THEIR OWN DOMAIN called GoogleVideo, where you can just right click and download the video, I think they are wrong on this, or their Terms Of Service is meaningless in this instancde

The earlier videos were ripped from downyoutube.net a YouTube downloading site, until the site ran into issues, and I found a WAY better alternative: VLC media player

Another thing that says Googles TOS is wrong, VLC has an option to rip a video from any site, and it does it well. I have been able to just copy the link and get the content through Mozilla FireFox or Google Chrome, and then convert it any way I want

Some compilations were made by me using Windows Movie Maker

Audio files are mostly just converted MP4/WEBM files from VLC media player, the only exception being M4A files, which were just downloaded from my old YouTube video downloading site

Don't worry, this is all legal! :)
