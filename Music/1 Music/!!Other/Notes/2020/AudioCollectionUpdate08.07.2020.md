# Music download August 7th 2020

I only downloaded a single song today. I check the Discord acknowledgements page every once in a while ever since I installed on my new laptop.

Today I noticed that there was a 14 second MP3 file playing in the background, so I checked the pages resources and didn't find it.

Luckily, my [video downloader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-downloadhelper/) was able to pick it up.
