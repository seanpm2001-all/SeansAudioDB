# Audio collection update August 28th 2020

New plan for maintaining the collection: a new release will be published with every day with a new playlist(s) or playlist file set.

I downloaded a little bit of music today. I recently realized that I have been forgetting to add music from mobile games.

Also note, I found a functional way of recording decent quality audio through my phone. I have been holding off the re-recording of the Major Mayhem soundtrack for a bit, as I have been lacking the time or storage space.

I was trying out crappy apps to get money in some games. This particular app disabled my developer options (I was able to reconfigure them easily) and it was just a shady music app where you listen to music to "earn real money" I hate contributing to these scams, but I was desperate for gold in AdVenture Capitalist. You can help me undo my contribution by NOT installing software where you earn "free money" because these are always a scam. I knew that going in, and I got my 4 gold out of it.
