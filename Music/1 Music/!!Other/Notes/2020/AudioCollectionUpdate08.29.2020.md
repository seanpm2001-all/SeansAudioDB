# Audio collection update August 29th 2020

New plan for maintaining the collection: a new release will be published with every day with a new playlist(s) or playlist file set.

I downloaded a little bit of music today. I recently realized that I have been forgetting to add music from mobile games.

I purchasesd some new music to support one of my favorite musicians today. Read more below.

Music purchases

After listening to the first song of the happy street soundtrack, I had a rush of happy emotions and nostalgia, and I became happier than I have been in months. Romain Gauthier composed the soundtracks for 2 other games from my childhood as well (iBlast Moki and iBlast Moki 2) and due to this surge of happiness tonight, I decided to give him a little of my support. I tried adding a few cents to the purchase as a bonus, something I haven't done before on Bandcamp. I don't know if it went through, but Romain G. really helped me be happier today.
