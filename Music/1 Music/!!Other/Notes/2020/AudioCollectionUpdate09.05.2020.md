# Audio collection update September 5th 2020

I haven't had the time to make the list for new audio recently. Today I plan on creating a new release for the audio database, so I needed to do this first.

New plan for maintaining the collection: a new release will be published with every day with a new playlist(s) or playlist file set. I have failed on this goal for a few days

I downloaded a little bit of music today. I recently realized that I have been forgetting to add music from mobile games.

Family Guy - Bird is the word (DOWNLOADED SEPTEMBER 3RD 2020 (09.03.2020))
