# Audio collection update September 6th 2020

New plan for maintaining the collection: a new release will be published with every day with a new playlist(s) or playlist file set. I have failed on this goal for a few days

I downloaded a little bit of music today. I recently realized that I have been forgetting to add music from mobile games.
