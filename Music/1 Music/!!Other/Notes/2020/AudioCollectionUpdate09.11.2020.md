# Audio collection update September 11th 2020

New plan for maintaining the collection: a new release will be published with every day with a new playlist(s) or playlist file set. I have failed on this goal for a few days

I downloaded a little bit of music yesterday, and some music 1 day earlier. I noticed some songs from the radio I haven't obtained yet, and also some songs playing in the background I haven't downloaded yet as well. These notes were made 1 day late

Pocket Trains main theme (DOWNLOADED SEPTEMBER 9TH 2020 (09.09.2020))
