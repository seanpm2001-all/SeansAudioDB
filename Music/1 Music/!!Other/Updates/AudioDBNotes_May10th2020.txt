Finalizations to the audio DB {
1▪ More HR within notes
2▪ Finish folding notes
3▪ Get icons (Small and large)
4▪ Update sidebar
5▪ Update index
6▪ Create separate wishlist entries (label the ones with content with a marker, the rest remain blank) this will also make updating the sidebar and index significantly easier
The marker code will be: [DATA AVAILABLE]
The marker code for the rest will be [DATA UNAVAILABLE] mark the available data first
7▪ Get some functions started (expand all, dark theme, fold all, light theme)
8▪ Wishlist, notes, and downloads year folds should also have an all-time (2019-present) fold as well
9▪ Final cleanup
