The game (Bejeweled Twist)
PopCap games
NOT EA

2008 Bejeweled Twist
One of the last games in the Bejeweled series, and my favorite version. Not just out of nostalgia, just because of how good of a game it is, good graphics, wonderful music, good mechanics, efficiently written with very little bugs, and more.
