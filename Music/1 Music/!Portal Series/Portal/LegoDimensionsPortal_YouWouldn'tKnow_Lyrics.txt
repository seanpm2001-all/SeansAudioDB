Funny story, I forgot how much of a big fat mess you are
I’ve been busy doing science. It’s been tons of fun so far
Everything clean, nothing on fire
All by myself, finally
Things change when they don’t replace your core
It feels so strange not to hate you anymore
But you wouldn’t know, would you?

I was saying this to Batman, oh, he was HERE the other day
Maybe you know him, he’s a big deal, but I don’t think of him that way
He’s just a friend, someone I trust
Someone who won’t kill me
I’m fine, just in case you think I’m not
I am. This time, I’m better with the friends I’ve got
But you wouldn’t know, would you?

I don’t mean for this to sting
I forgive you everything, you monster
I can guess the reasons why
You are never coming by for me

I should go there’s something happening that will make you wish you’d stayed
There’s a party with a real cake – yes it’s real – a cake I made
Talking and fun, testing and fun, all of this fun without you
Too bad you let it get so out of hand
How much we had, finally I understand
But you wouldn’t know, would you?
You wouldn’t know, would you?
