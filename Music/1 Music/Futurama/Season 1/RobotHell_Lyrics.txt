[LYRICS]
Robot Devil : Cigars are evil, you won't miss 'em,
We'll find ways to simulate that smell,
What a sorry fella, rolled up and smoked like a Panetela, here on level one of Robot Hell!

Robot Devil : Gambling's wrong and so is cheating. So is forging phony IOU's,
Let's let lady luck decide, what type of torture's justified.
I'm pit boss here on level two!

Bender: [singing] Just tell me why!
Robot Devil : Please read this 55-page warrant.
Bender: There must be robots worse than I!
Robot Devil :  We've checked around, there really aren't.
Bender: Then please let me explain, my crimes were merely boyish pranks!
Robot Devil : You stole from boy scouts, nuns and banks!
Bender: Aw, don't blame me,
Blame my upbringing!
Robot Devil : Please stop sinning while I'm singing!
Selling bootleg tapes is wrong, musicians need that income to survive
Beastie Boys: Hey, Bender, gonna make some noise, with your hard drive scratched by the Beastie Boys?
That's whatcha, whatcha, whatcha get on level five!

[CUT TO... Fry and Leela sliding down an enormous slide, the regular tune returns to the song]
Fry: I don't feel well...
Leela: It's up to us to rescue him!
Fry: Maybe he likes it here in Hell...
Leela: It's us who tempted him to sin!
Fry: Maybe he's back at the motel?
Leela: Come on, Fry, don't be scared,
I'm sure at least one of us will be spared,
So just sit back, enjoy the ride.
Fry: My ass has blisters from the slide!

Robot Devil: Fencing diamonds, fixing cockfights,
publishing indecent magazines,
you'll pay for every crime, knee-deep in electric slime,
you'll suffer till the end of time, enduring tortures, most of which rhyme,
trapped forever here in Robot Hell!
