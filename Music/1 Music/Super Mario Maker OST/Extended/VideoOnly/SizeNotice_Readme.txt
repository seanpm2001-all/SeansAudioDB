Video Size Notice [read-me]:

I feel like it would be a WAY better idea to keep video and audio separate this time, since all the videos are the same image and the same length
The memory consumption currently isn't worth it, if I were to get all 119 videos as just video, that would take up about 15 gigabytes, when it can easily just be less than 250 megabytes. Try pairing that with audio, which would take about 7 more gigabytes
I only downloaded 1 video as an example, audio can be added in the future when I have the software to merge video and audio together, and when I have enough time and space.
Since this is the BLANK video section, I will likely never add more here, as it is redundant, and not worth it at all. - Sean Patrick Myrick
