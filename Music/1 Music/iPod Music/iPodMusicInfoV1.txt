iPod music info

When I used to have an iPod 4/iPod 5, I would occassionally download music from iTunes, as there was a free download every week
There were 13 songs

Since I moved on from Apple, I don't have the songs anymore (as of August 23rd 2019, I only have Vance Joy - Riptide)
I am far from Apple now. I am going to have to find all of the original songs. Luckily, I remember their thumbnails, and what they sound like.

Recollection:

To get the full effect, only keep .MP3 versions of the files in this folder.
